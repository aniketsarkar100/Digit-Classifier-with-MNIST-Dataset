# Digit-Classifier-with-MNIST-Dataset
This project is a complete implementation of a handwritten digit classifier using PyTorch and the MNIST dataset. The model is a simple fully connected neural network (Multilayer Perceptron) that takes 28x28 grayscale images of handwritten digits as input and predicts the digit (0-9). The project demonstrates the entire machine learning pipeline â€” including data loading, preprocessing, model building, training, evaluation, and visualization. It also splits the data into training, validation, and test sets to provide a realistic evaluation of model performance. Loss and accuracy graphs are plotted to monitor the training process, helping visualize model learning and avoid overfitting.

In addition to training the model, the project visualizes sample predictions and generates a confusion matrix to better interpret classification performance across different digit classes. Achieving around 97-98% accuracy on the test set, this project is a great example of using PyTorch for practical machine learning tasks. It can serve as a template for similar classification problems in deep learning. The entire code is structured to run in one go, making it beginner-friendly, while also including important evaluation metrics and visualizations for a holistic machine learning project.
